You select an element randomly (pivot) and then divide the list into elements less than pivot and elements higher than pivot. 
So you divide one array into two arrays. After you selected the pivot you perform comparison (conditional statement) and perform element swapping. 

Then in each of these arrays you select a pivot element and repeat everything for this divided array.
