With this sorting algorithm you are swapping elements next to each other. You have a condition that verifies if an element next to it (adjacent) is bigger or smaller 
and if it is bigger it changes their position and so on. So with first iteration you will get the biggest element to the end, 
with next iteration you will get the second biggest element to the second position at the end (from right to left), etc.

Here we have nested loops (2 loops). The first loop continues iterating when the second loop is finished.
