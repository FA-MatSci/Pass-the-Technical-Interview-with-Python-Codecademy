Syllabus:
1) Welcome to Interview Prep in Python (Get started with an overview of data structures, algorithms, and dig into building your first data structure!)
2) Linear Data Structures (Learn to build various linear abstract data types in Python, such as linked lists, queues, and stacks.)
3) Hash Maps (Learn about hash maps, a key-value data storage structure with very efficient lookup performance.)
4) Algorithmic Concepts (Learn algorithm fundamentals, including recursive vs. iterative patterns and Big O asymptotic notation.)
5) Nonlinear Data Structures (A conceptual and Python-specific introduction to Trees, Binary Search Trees, and Heaps.)
6) Sorting Algorithms (Learn about sorting algorithms in Python.)
7) Graphs and Graph Traversals (Learn to build a Graph in Python, and then traverse it using depth-first search, breadth-first search, and Dijkstraâ€™s and A* algorithms.)
8) Interview Prep and Practice Problems (Learn some common interviewing tricks and tips. Then practice some real interview questions in Python.)
