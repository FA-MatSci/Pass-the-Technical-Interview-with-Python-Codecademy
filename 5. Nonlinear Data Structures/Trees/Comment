You create a tree (root at the top and it grows down). At the top you have a parent and from there you have children.



					       parent
				          /	\
				         /	 \
				    child_1   child_2
				    /	\	     /	  \
				   /	 \	  /	     \
				  

Then you traverse through conditions (which you set) in the traverse functions (you decide where to travel).

You have a list where you store objects, created by instantiation.


If you have data in a tree form then you can search through it.
