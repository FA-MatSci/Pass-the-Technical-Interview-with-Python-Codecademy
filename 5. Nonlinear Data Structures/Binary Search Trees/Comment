You have a tree where nodes are instances of the root class.

On the left side you are adding values lower than the root and on the right side, higher than the root.

These are class values:

						          15
					          /     \
					       10        50
					      / \        / \   
					    5   12      60 70

The rule is that on the left side there is a value lower than the value one level above and on the right side higher.

Looking from the root, left side will always contain values lower than the root and right side the higher ones.


When you are searching for values, you start with the root and go down based on the conditions. 
For traversing, the code is set so that you get a list of values from the lowest to the highest.
