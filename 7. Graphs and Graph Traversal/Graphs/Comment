Here you create a graph, for instance:

					          O
				           / \
				          O - O
				          |
				          O

O represents a vertex where you store data. Connections between vertexes are called edges. 
These are distances between them or how much effort it takes to go between the two. Vertexes can be directed (travel between them is restricted to a single direction) 
or bi-directional (they can go both ways).

You typically represent them by a dictionary.
