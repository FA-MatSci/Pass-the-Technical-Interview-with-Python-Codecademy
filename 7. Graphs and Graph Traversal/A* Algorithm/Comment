A* algorithm is a modification of Djikstra in a sense that it is more optimized. 
It doesn’t look for every possible way that exist in a graph search (that’s why you include a target). That means that not every vertex is searched as opposed to Djikstra. 
Here we add an estimated distance of each vertex to the goal vertex.

Heuristic function estimates likely distance between a start and a target.
