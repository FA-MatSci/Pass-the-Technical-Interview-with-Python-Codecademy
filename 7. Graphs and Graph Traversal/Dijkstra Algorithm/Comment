This algorithm computes the shortest distance from a given vertex to the rest of the vertices in a graph.

For this algorithm, you compare distances for a given graph between each other until you get the smallest one. 
In a graph, you need to have vertices and their weights (the distance or effort it takes to go from point A to B).
