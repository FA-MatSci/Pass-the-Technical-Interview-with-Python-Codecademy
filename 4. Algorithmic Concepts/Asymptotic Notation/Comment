Here you are talking about different runtimes of your code, how to make it more efficient and which ones (if you compare them) are the most efficient. 
It is important to have an optimized code.

This chapter also briefly talks about space complexity (how many new variables are generated during the execution of the code. In that case, space complexity would be high).
